## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on **correcting biases in citizen-collected bird observation data** using advanced machine learning techniques. Citizen-science datasets like eBird often have sampling biases, which can affect ecological analyses.  

The pipeline combines **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model spatial and relational structures in bird observations, with **XGBoost** for robust prediction and bias correction.
